# Facial_Detection
# Drowsiness Detection System using OpenCV and Tensorflow

The project is used to detect drowsiness in drivers and alerts them with an alarm if the system finds the driver drowsy.
The system considers a person drowsy if their eyes remain shut for a threshold amount of time and triggers an alarm to wake the person up.

Imutils was used the first time to detect the facial landmarks on a person.
After the Imutils failed to detect the facial landmarks clearly, haarcascades were used.
