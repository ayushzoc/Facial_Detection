# Drowsiness Detection System

### Overview:
---
* A Computer Vision tool to detect drowsiness in drivers. 
* The system is alerted if the driver is found sleepy/drowsy. 
* The driver is determined sleepy/drowsy if their eyes remain shut for a small threshold amount of time which triggers an alarm to wake the driver up.
* Initially used IMutils for facial detection which resulted in incorrect facial landmark detection multiple times.
* Haarcascades facial landmark detection was used.
